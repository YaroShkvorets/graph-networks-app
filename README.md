# The Graph Networks Registry

This is a simple demo app for the [The Graph Networks Registry](https://github.com/graphprotocol/networks-registry) hosted at https://graph-networks-app.vercel.app

It uses [the Registry Typescript library](https://github.com/pinax-network/graph-networks-libs/) to fetch the registry JSON.

If something doesn't look right please open an issue or submit a PR in [the Registry repository](https://github.com/graphprotocol/networks-registry)
